# Passport-OpenAm

General-purpose OpenAm authentication strategies for [Passport](https://github.com/jaredhanson/passport).

This module lets you authenticate using OpenAm in your Node.js applications.
By plugging into Passport, OpenAm authentication can be easily and unobtrusively
integrated into any application or framework that supports
[Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware, including
[Express](http://expressjs.com/).

OpenAM is an open source access management, entitlements and federation server platform.
